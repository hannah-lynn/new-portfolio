            I'm a self taught, full stack developer, from Manchester, UK. I
            started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript in 2019, when I
            was in New Zealand, and was really happy to start a full time
            developer role in October 2020.

            I enjoy building web apps in my spare time, where I build things,
            like this website. I'm constantly looking for new things to learn
            and better ways to write my code, that's part of why I love coding.

            Previously, I worked as a Deputy Store Manager of a 60,000sq ft
            Tesco Extra, with a turnover of Â£450k per week, and also at Urban
            Outfitters in Berlin. Working in retail management has given me a
            great perspective.

            I'm always thinking of the customer journey - how to drive sales,
            footfall, reduce loss and also working together, leading a team to
            exceed targets.

            In my spare time I like to grow houseplants and travel. I've lived
            and worked in 5 countries and travelled many more. One of my
            favorite memories is climbing 'Volcan Acatenango', in Guatemala. We
            camped 4000m up and watched the neighbouring Volcano, Fuego, erupt
            every 10 minutes!

            I'm currently volunteering as a mentor for School of Code and
            Care4Calais, a volunteer run refugee charity where I help give
            direct aid and support to asylum seekers and refugees.
